      <p>I am a software engineer with over 10 years of realtime and embedded software design, test, and programming experience.</p>
      <p>I am looking to return to professional work after taking a career break to raise my children.  During this intermission I volunteered literally 1000s of hours of my time.  I’m ready to be paid again for my time, talents and skills.  Both my boys are in college and I’m in a position to commit to full time employment including travel.</p>
      <p>I'm currently enrolled in SMU’s Programming Boot Camp to bring my programming experience 
        up-to-date.  I’m confident that I have skills and attributes that your company is looking 
        for and would very much welcome the opportunity to discuss my <a href="SMUResume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> in person.</p>
      <p>Please see my <a href="portfolio.html" target="_blank">Portfolio Page</a> to view my class projects.</p>
